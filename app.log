Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”\nI didn’t invent them, they’re there.\nIn all of them, that is the point.\nUm, Penny, that’s where I sit.\nNo, I sit there.\nWhat’s the difference?\nIn the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration.

Leonard can’t process corn.\nYou’re lactose intolerant.\nYes.\nWhat’s happening.\nIt took you four years to get through High School?\nYou? No, you’ll only make it worse.\nYes.\nWell this is an interesting development.\nIt has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\nPoint taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.\nSo, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\nThat woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.\nOh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed.\nYes, but not of the same species.\nOh, of course.\nNo?

Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”\nI didn’t invent them, they’re there.\nIn all of them, that is the point.\nUm, Penny, that’s where I sit.\nNo, I sit there.\nWhat’s the difference?\nIn the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration.

Leonard can’t process corn.\nYou’re lactose intolerant.\nYes.\nWhat’s happening.\nIt took you four years to get through High School?\nYou? No, you’ll only make it worse.\nYes.\nWell this is an interesting development.\nIt has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.\nPoint taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out.\nSo, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\nThat woman in there’s not going to have sex with you.\nOh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed.\nYes, but not of the same species.\nOh, of course.\nNo?

That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you. Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed. Yes, but not of the same species. Oh, of course. No? You’ll only make it worse.

Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation. Yeah. If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure. Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?” I didn’t invent them, they’re there. In all of them, that is the point. Um, Penny, that’s where I sit. No, I sit there. What’s the difference? In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. Well. Fine. Aaah! That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning. I resent you saying we don’t have company. That is an antisocial implication. Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow affects your personality. That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn. You’re lactose intolerant. Yes. What’s happening. It took you four years to get through High School? You? No, you’ll only make it worse. Yes. Well this is an interesting development. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment. Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you. Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed. Yes, but not of the same species. Oh, of course. No? You’ll only make it worse. Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo? It’s Darth Vader shampoo. Leonard has a lady over. Technically that would be coitus interruptus.\n\nAvailable Entities:\n- Sheldon (person)\n\nCreate a JSON object containing found relationships.

Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation. Yeah. If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure. Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?” I didn’t invent them, they’re there. In all of them, that is the point. Um, Penny, that’s where I sit. No, I sit there. What’s the difference? In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. Well. Fine. Aaah! That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning. I resent you saying we don’t have company. That is an antisocial implication. Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow affects your personality. That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn. You’re lactose intolerant. Yes. What’s happening. It took you four years to get through High School? You? No, you’ll only make it worse. Yes. Well this is an interesting development. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment. Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you. Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed. Yes, but not of the same species. Oh, of course. No? You’ll only make it worse. Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo? It’s Darth Vader shampoo. Leonard has a lady over. Technically that would be coitus interruptus.\n\nAvailable Entities:\n- Sheldon (person)\n- Sheldon (named_person): The main character of the conversation, known for his eccentric personality and strict adherence to rules.\n- Penny (named_person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often involved in his social interactions and relationships.\n- Koothrapali (named_person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often mentioned in the context of social gatherings and activities.\n- Wolowitz (named_person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often mentioned in the context of social gatherings and activities.\n- Leonard (named_person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often involved in his social interactions and relationships.\n- MIT (named_organization): A prestigious university, referenced as a place where intellectual ideas are often discussed.\n- Quantum Mechanics (concrete_topic): A complex scientific field, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- String Theory (concrete_topic): A theoretical framework in physics, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Bourne-Oppenheimer Approximation (concrete_topic): A scientific concept, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Differential (concrete_topic): A mathematical concept, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Klingon Boggle (action/passion): A social activity, referenced as a way for friends to spend time together.\n- High School (concrete_topic): A level of education, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Lactose Intolerance (concrete_topic): A medical condition, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Luke Skywalker (action/passion): A cultural reference, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Darth Vader (action/passion): A cultural reference, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Coitus Interruptus (action/passion): A social activity, referenced as a way for friends to spend time together.\n- Antisocial Implication (emotion): A feeling or attitude, referenced as a way to describe Sheldon\'s reaction to a situation.\n- Disappointment (emotion): A feeling or attitude, referenced as a way to describe Sheldon\'s reaction to a situation.\n- Frustration (emotion): A feeling or attitude, referenced as a way to describe Sheldon\'s reaction to a situation.\n\nCreate a JSON object containing found relationships.

Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?” I didn’t invent them, they’re there. In all of them, that is the point. Um, Penny, that’s where I sit. No, I sit there. What’s the difference? In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. Well. Fine. Aaah! That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning. I resent you saying we don’t have company. That is an antisocial implication. Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow affects your personality. That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn. You’re lactose intolerant. Yes. What’s happening. It took you four years to get through High School? You? No, you’ll only make it worse. Yes. Well this is an interesting development. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment. Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you. Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed. Yes, but not of the same species. Oh, of course. No? You’ll only make it worse. Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo? It’s Darth Vader shampoo. Leonard has a lady over.

Yeah, well, it’s just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that’s just a joke, it’s a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation. Yeah. If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at MIT, sure. Oh, come on. Who hasn’t seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?” I didn’t invent them, they’re there. In all of them, that is the point. Um, Penny, that’s where I sit. No, I sit there. What’s the difference? In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. Well. Fine. Aaah! That’s not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning. I resent you saying we don’t have company. That is an antisocial implication. Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow affects your personality. That’s interesting. Leonard can’t process corn. You’re lactose intolerant. Yes. What’s happening. It took you four years to get through High School? You? No, you’ll only make it worse. Yes. Well this is an interesting development. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment. Point taken. It has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out. So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? That woman in there’s not going to have sex with you. Oh, good. Then you won’t be disappointed. Yes, but not of the same species. Oh, of course. No? You’ll only make it worse. Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo? It’s Darth Vader shampoo. Leonard has a lady over. Technically that would be coitus interruptus.\n\nAvailable Entities:\n- Sheldon (person)\n- Sheldon (Named_Person): The main character of the conversation, known for his eccentric personality and strict adherence to rules.\n- Penny (Named_Person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often involved in his social interactions and relationships.\n- Koothrapali (Named_Person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often mentioned in the context of social gatherings and activities.\n- Wolowitz (Named_Person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often mentioned in the context of social gatherings and activities.\n- Leonard (Named_Person): A friend of Sheldon\'s, often involved in his social interactions and relationships.\n- MIT (Named_Organization): A prestigious university, referenced as a place where intellectual ideas are often discussed.\n- Quantum Mechanics (Concrete_Topic): A complex scientific field, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- String Theory (Concrete_Topic): A theoretical framework in physics, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Bourne-Oppenheimer Approximation (Concrete_Topic): A scientific concept, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Differential (Concrete_Topic): A mathematical concept, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Klingon Boggle (Action/Passion): A social activity, referenced as a way for friends to spend time together.\n- High School (Concrete_Topic): A level of education, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Lactose Intolerance (Concrete_Topic): A medical condition, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Luke Skywalker (Action/Passion): A cultural reference, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Darth Vader (Action/Passion): A cultural reference, referenced as a topic of discussion and intellectual exploration.\n- Coitus Interruptus (Action/Passion): A social activity, referenced as a way for friends to spend time together.\n- Antisocial Implication (Emotion): A feeling or attitude, referenced as a way to describe Sheldon\'s reaction to a situation.\n- Disappointment (Emotion): A feeling or attitude, referenced as a way to describe Sheldon\'s reaction to a situation.\n- Frustration (Emotion): A feeling or attitude, referenced as a way to describe Sheldon\'s reaction to a situation.\n\nCreate a JSON object containing found relationships.
